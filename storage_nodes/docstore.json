Put the transparent eggcrate  on the zoom module (6) and screw it with three screws (4) with washers to \nthe zoom module (6).  \n4. Place the transparent cover (3) and the  top flange (2) back to the head and secure it with four screws (1).\n\t\n\t\n\u0018\n3.4 Rigging the fixture\nThe installation of the fixture has to be built and constructed in a way that it can hold 10 times the weight for 1 \nhour without any harming deformation.\nThe installation must always be secured with a secondary safety attachment, e.g. an appropriate catch net. \nThis secondary safety attachment must be constructed in a way that no part of the installation can fall down if \nthe main attachment fails.\nWhen rigging, derigging or servicing the fixture staying in the area below the installation place, on bridges, \nunder high working places and other endangered areas is forbidden.\nThe operator has to make sure that safety-relating and machine-technical installations are approved by an expert \nbefore taking into operation for the first time and after changes before taking into operation another time.\nThe operator has to make sure that safety-relating and machine-technical installations are approved by an \nexpert after every four year in the course of an acceptance test.\nThe operator has to make sure that safety-relating and machine-technical installations are approved by a skilled \nperson once a year.\nThe fixture should be installed outside areas where persons may walk by or be seated.\nIMPORTANT! OVERHEAD RIGGING REQUIRES EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE, including (but not limited to) \ncalculating working load limits, installation material being used, and periodic safety inspection of all installation \nmaterial and the projector. If you lack these qualifications, do not attempt the installation yourself, but instead \nuse a professional structural rigger. Improper installation can result in bodily injury or damage to property.\nThe fixture has to be installed out of the reach of people.\nIf the fixture shall be lowered from the ceiling or high joists, professional trussing systems have to be used. The \nfixture must never be fixed swinging freely in the room.\nCaution: Fixture  may cause severe injuries when crashing down! If you have doubts concerning the safety of \na possible installation, do not install the moving head!\nBefore rigging make sure that the installation area can hold a minimum point load of 10 times the fixture\u2019s \nweight.\n\t\nWhen installing the device, make sure there is no highly inflammable\n\t\nmaterial (decoration articles, etc.) in a distance of min. 0.5 m.\nCAUTION!\n\t\n\t\nUse an appropriate clamp to rig the fixture on the truss.\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n Follow the instructions mentioned at the bottom of the base.\t\n\t\n\t\nMake sure that the device is fixed properly! Ensure that the \nstructure (truss) to which you are attaching the fixtures is secure.\nThe  fixture can be placed directly on the stage floor or rigged on a truss without altering its operation characte\u00ad\nristics .\nFor securing a fixture to the truss install a safety wire that can hold at least 10 times the weight of the fixture. \nUse only  safety wire with screw-on carabine. Pull the safety wire  through the carrying handles and around the \ntruss as shown on the pictures below.\nNote: If the safety wire is too long, whip it several times  around the trusss in order to attach the fixture tight. \nIn case of an accident, the way of the falling fixture will be short. \n.\n.\n10\nRigging via two Omega holders \nSecuring the fixture via one safety wire\t\n\t\nSecuring the fixture via two safety wires\nThe fixture can be also rigged by means of the mounting adapter (option) for one Omega holder:.\nIn this case the fixture can hang on the truss in horizontal position only, not sideways .\n1-Fixture\n2-Omega holder\n3-Clamp\n4-Trust\n5-Safety chain\n11\n3.5 DMX-512 connection\nThe fixture is equipped with both 3-pin and 5-pin XLR sockets for DMX input and output.The sockets are  wired \nin parallel.\nOnly use a  shielded twisted-pair cable designed for RS-485 and 3-pin or 5-pin  XLR-plugs and connectors in \norder to connect the controller with the fixture or one fixture with another.\nDMX - output\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nDMX-input\nXLR mounting-sockets (rear view):\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\nXLR mounting-plugs (rear view):\n If you are using the standard DMX controllers, you can connect the DMX output of the controller directly with \nthe DMX input of the first fixture in the DMX-chain. If you wish to connect DMX-controllers with other XLR-out-\nputs, you need to use adapter-cables.\nBuilding a serial DMX-chain:\nConnect the DMX-output of the first fixture in the DMX-chain with the DMX-input of the next fixture. Always \nconnect one output with the input of the next fixture until all fixtures are connected.\nCaution: At the last fixture, the DMX-cable has to be terminated with a terminator. Solder a 120 \u03a9 resistor \nbetween Signal (\u2013) and Signal (+) into a 3-pin XLR-plug and plug it in the DMX-output of the last fixture.\n1 - Shield\n2 - Signal (-)\n3 - Signal (+)\n4 - Not connected\n5 - Not connected\n1 - Shield\n2 - Signal (-)\n3 - Signal (+)\n4 - Not connected\n5 - Not connected\n12\n3.6 Ethernet connection\nThe fixtures on a data link are connected to the Ethernet with ArtNet communication protocol.The control soft-\nware running on your PC (or light console) has to support Art-Net protocol.\nArt-Net communication protocol is a 10 Base T Ethernet protocol based on the TCP/IP.Its purpose is to allow \ntransfer of large amounts of DMX 512 data over a wide area using standard network technology.\nIP address is the Internet protocol address.The IP uniquely identifies any node (fixture) on a network.\nThe Universe  is a single DMX 512 frame of 512 channels.\nThe Robin 300E Wash is equipped with 8-pin RJ- 45 socket for Ethernet input.Use a network cable category 5 \n(with four \u201ctwisted\u201d wire pairs) and standard RJ-45 plugs in order to connect the fixture to the network.\n     RJ-45 socket (front view):\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n                       RJ-45 plug (front view):\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n1- TD+    \t\n\t\n5- Not connected \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n2- TD-\t \t\n\t\n6- RX-\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n3- RX+\t \t\n\t\n7- Not connected\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n4- Not connected\t\n8- Not connected\nPatch cables that connect fixtures to the hubs or LAN sockets are wired 1:1,that is,pins with the same numbers \nare connected together:\n\t\n1-1\t\n2-2\t\n3-3\t\n4-4\t\n5-5\t\n6-6\t\n7-7\t\n8-8\t\n\t\nIf only the fixture and the computer are to be interconnected,no hubs or other active components are needed.\nA cross-cable has to be used:\n\t\n1-3\t\n2-6\t\n3-1\t\n4-8\t\n5-7\t\n6-2\t\n7-5\t\n8-4\nIf the fixture is connected with active Ethernet socket (e.g. switch) the network icon \n will appear at the \nbottom right corner of the screen:\nDirect Ethernet operation\nConnect the Ethernet inputs of all fixtures with the Ethernet network.\nOption \u201c Artnet (gMaI or gMA2)\" has to be selected from \u201cEthernet Mode\u201d menu on the fixture.\nSet IP address (002.xxx.xxx.xxx / 010.xxx.xxx.xxx) and the Universe.\n\t\n(DMX address=46)\t\n\t\n(DMX address=23)\t\n\t\n (DMX address=1)\n \t\nIP addres=002.168.002.004\t\nIP addres=002.168.002.003\t\n IP addres=002.168.002.002\n             Universe=1\t\n\t\n\t\nUniverse=1\t\n\t\n\t\n Universe=1\t\n\t\nAn advised PC setting: IP address: 002.xxx.xxx.xxx / 010.xxx.xxx.xxx (Different from fixture IP addresses) \n\t\n\t\n            NET mask: 255.0.0.0\n13\nEthernet / DMX operation\nOptions \u201cArt2DMX\u201d has to be selected from the \u201cEthernet Mode\u201d menu on the first fixture (connected to the \nEthernet) in the fixture chain,next fixtures have standard DMX setting.\nConnect the Ethernet-input of the first fixture in the data chain with the network.

RDM\nThis fixture supports RDM operation. RDM (Remote Device Management) is a bi-directional communications \nprotocol for use in DMX512 control systems, it is the new open standard for DMX512 device configuration and \nstatus monitoring.\nThe RDM protocol allows data packets to be inserted into a DMX512 data stream without adversely affecting \nexisting non-RDM equipment. By using a special \u201eStart Code,\u201c and by complying with the timing specifications \nfor DMX512, the RDM protocol allows a console or dedicated RDM controller to send commands to and receive \nmessages from specific moving lights.\nRDM allows explicit commands to be sent to a device and responses to be received from it. \nThe list of commands for Robin 600 LEDWash is the following.\nParameter ID\nDiscovery command\nSET command\nGET command\nDISC_UNIQUE_BRANCH\n*\nDISC_MUTE\n*\nDISC_UN_MUTE\n*\nDEVICE_INFO\n*\nSUPPORTED_PARAMETERS\n*\n33\nSOFTWARE_VERSION_LABEL\n*\nDMX_START_ADDRESS\n*\n*\nIDENTIFY_DEVICE\n*\n*\nDEVICE_MODEL_DESCRIPTION\n*\nMANUFACTURER_LABEL\n*\nDEVICE_LABEL\n*\n*\nSENSOR_DEFINITION\n*\nSENSOR_VALUE\n*\nDISPLAY_INVERT\n*\n*\nDISPLAY_LEVEL\n*\n*\nPAN_INVERT\n*\n*\nTILT_INVERT\n*\n*\nDEVICE_RESET\n*\nDMX_PERSONALITY\n*\n*\nDMX_PERSONALITY_DESCRIPTION\n*\nSTATUS_MESSAGES\n*\nSTATUS_ID_DESCRIPTION\n*\nDEVICE_HOURS  2\n*\n8.

Maintenance and cleaning\nIt is absolutely essential that the fixture is kept clean and that dust, dirt and smoke-fluid residues must not build \nup on or within the fixture. Otherwise, the fixture\u2018s light-output will be significantly reduced. Regular cleaning will \nnot only ensure the maximum light-output, but will also allow the fixture to function reliably throughout its life. \nA soft lint-free cloth moistened with any good glass cleaning fluid is recommended, under no circumstances \nshould alcohol or solvents be used!\nDANGER !\nDisconnect from the mains before starting any\nmaintenance work\nThe head\u00b4s transparent cover  will require weekly cleaning as smoke-fluid tends to building up residues, reduc-\ning the light-output very quickly. The cooling fans should be cleaned monthly.\nThe interior of the base should be cleaned at least annually using a vacuum-cleaner or an air-jet.\nMore complicated maintenance and service operations are only to be carried out by authorized distributors.\n11.1 Replacing fuse\nIOnly replace the fuse by a fuse of the same type and rating.\nBefore replacing the fuse, unplug mains lead!\nIf you need to replace the main fuse, follow the instrustions:\n\t\n 1) Remove the rear cover of the base by unscrewing 6 fastening screws.\n\t\n 2) Remove the old fuse from the fuseholder.\n\t\n 3) Install the new fuse into the fuseholder.\n\t\n 4) Replace the rear cover back to the base..\n37\n38\n12.
